            "1": "The beginning of the good news of Jesus, Messiah, [the Son of God].",
            "2": "As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way,",
            "3": "a voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.’”",
            "4": "John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.",
            "5": "The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.",
            "6": "John wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.",
            "7": "He proclaimed: “After me comes one stronger than I, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.",
            "8": "I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”",
            "9": "In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.",
            "10": "And immediately, as he came up out of the water, he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.",
            "11": "And a voice came from heaven: “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”",
            "12": "At once the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.",
            "13": "He was in the wilderness forty days, being tested by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels were serving him.",
            "14": "After John was handed over, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God:",
            "15": "“The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near. Repent and believe the good news!”",
            "16": "As he was walking along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, Simon’s brother, casting a net into the sea—for they were fishermen.",
            "17": "Jesus said to them, “Come, follow me, and I will make you become fishers of people.”",
            "18": "Immediately they left their nets and followed him.",
            "19": "Going a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in their boat mending the nets.",
            "20": "Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.",
            "21": "They went into Capernaum. And right away on the Sabbath, Jesus went into the synagogue and began teaching.",
            "22": "They were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority, not like the scribes.",
            "23": "Just then a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit cried out,",
            "24": "“What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”",
            "25": "Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!”",
            "26": "The unclean spirit shook the man violently, cried out with a loud voice, and came out of him.",
            "27": "They were all amazed, so they asked one another, “What is this? A new teaching—with authority! He even commands unclean spirits, and they obey him.”",
            "28": "News about him spread quickly everywhere, throughout the whole region of Galilee.",
            "29": "As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.",
            "30": "Simon’s mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever, and they told Jesus about her right away.",
            "31": "He went to her, took her by the hand, and lifted her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.",
            "32": "That evening, after sunset, the people brought to him all who were sick and demon-possessed.",
            "33": "The whole town gathered at the door.",
            "34": "He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and he drove out many demons. But he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.",
            "35": "Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, went out, and made his way to a deserted place. There he was praying.",
            "36": "Simon and his companions went searching for him.",
            "37": "When they found him, they said, “Everyone is looking for you!”",
            "38": "He said to them, “Let’s go on to the neighboring villages, so that I may preach there also. That is why I have come.”",
            "39": "So he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.",
            "40": "A man with leprosy came to him and, kneeling down, begged him: “If you are willing, you can make me clean.”",
            "41": "Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand, touched him, and said, “I am willing. Be clean.”",
            "42": "Immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.",
            "43": "Jesus sternly warned him at once and sent him away,",
            "44": "saying, “See that you say nothing to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest, and offer what Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”",
            "45": "But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely and spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. Instead, he stayed out in deserted places. Yet people kept coming to him from everywhere."

            "1": "When he entered Capernaum again after some days, it was reported that he was at home.",
            "2": "So many gathered that there was no more room, not even at the door, and he was speaking the word to them.",
            "3": "Some men came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them.",
            "4": "Since they could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him. After digging through it, they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.",
            "5": "When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, “Child, your sins are forgiven.”",
            "6": "But some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts:",
            "7": "“Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except God alone?”",
            "8": "Right away Jesus knew in his spirit that they were thinking like this within themselves, and he said to them, “Why are you reasoning these things in your hearts?",
            "9": "Which is easier: to say to the paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat, and walk’?",
            "10": "But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the paralyzed man—",
            "11": "“I tell you: Get up, take your mat, and go home.”",
            "12": "He got up, immediately picked up the mat, and went out in front of everyone. So they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”",
            "13": "Jesus went out again beside the sea. The whole crowd came to him, and he taught them.",
            "14": "As he was passing by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he got up and followed him.",
            "15": "While he was reclining at the table in Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who were following him.",
            "16": "When the scribes of the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”",
            "17": "When Jesus heard this, he said to them, “Those who are well don’t need a doctor, but those who are sick do. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”",
            "18": "Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. People came and asked him, “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”",
            "19": "Jesus said to them, “The wedding guests cannot fast while the groom is with them, can they? As long as they have the groom with them, they cannot fast.",
            "20": "But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast on that day.",
            "21": "No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece pulls away from the old, and a worse tear is made.",
            "22": "And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins are lost. But new wine is for fresh wineskins.”",
            "23": "On the Sabbath he was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to make their way, picking heads of grain.",
            "24": "The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”",
            "25": "He said to them, “Have you never read what David and those who were with him did when he was in need and hungry—",
            "26": "how he entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the bread of the Presence, which is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests—and also gave some to his companions?”",
            "27": "Then he told them, “The Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath.",
            "28": "So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”"

            "3": "He told the man with the shriveled hand, “Stand before us.”",

            "5": "After looking around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, he told the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.",
            "6": "Immediately the Pharisees went out and started plotting with the Herodians against him, how they might kill him.",
            "7": "Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a large crowd followed from Galilee, Judea,",
            "8": "Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon. The large crowd came to him because they heard about everything he was doing.",
            "9": "Then he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, so that the crowd would not crush him.",
            "10": "Since he had healed many, all who had diseases were pressing forward to touch him.",
            "11": "Whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God!”",
            "12": "And he strictly ordered them not to make him known.",
            "13": "He went up the mountain and summoned those he wanted, and they came to him.",

            "17": "But they have no root in themselves; they are short-lived. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.",
            "18": "Others are sown among thorns: these are the ones who hear the word,",
            "19": "but the worries of this age, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.",
